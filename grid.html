                    Computer programming<br>
                 Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation<br>
                 (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually <br>
                 by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming <br>
                 involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling <br>
                 algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation<br>
                 of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly <br>
                 referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one<br>
                 or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than <br>
                 machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.<br>
                 The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that<br>
                 will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as <br>
                 an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.<br>
                 Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several <br>
                 different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, <br>
                 specialized algorithms, and formal logic.<br>
                 Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging,<br>
                 source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management<br>
                 of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. <br>
                 These might be considered part of the programming process, but often<br>
                 the term software development is used for this larger process with the <br>
                 term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual <br>
                 writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques <br>
                 with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related <br>
                 process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand and <br>
                 re-create/re-implement<br>
